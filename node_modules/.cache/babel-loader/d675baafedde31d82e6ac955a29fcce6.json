A Freelancer can request\n                      disbursement of available funds any time on a one-time\n                      basis or by setting up an automatic disbursement schedule.\n                      If Freelancer does not request a disbursement, Bearole\n                      will automatically disburse available funds no more than\n                      90 days after the Freelancer Fees are released to the\n                      Freelancer Escrow Account, unless the amount in the Escrow\n                      Account is less than the Minimum Threshold. For purposes\n                      of the Terms of Service, a “Minimum Threshold” is either\n                      (a) $100 for Freelancers within the United States, or (b)\n                      $1,000 for Freelancers outside the United States. When the\n                      funds in the Freelancer Escrow Account are below the\n                      Minimum Threshold, the automatic disbursement schedule is\n                      paused and the available and payable funds are released on\n                      the earlier of: (i) Freelancer’s request; (ii) on the\n                      first scheduled automatic disbursement occurring after the\n                      amount exceeds the Minimum Threshold; or (iii) 180 days\n                      after the funds are available in the Freelancer Escrow\n                      Account.

Freelancer Fees become\n                      available to Freelancers following the expiration of the\n                      dispute period and the five-day security period.\n                      Fixed-Price Contracts.

The User's\n                      Payment Method provider may also charge fees directly to\n                      the Payment Method even when no currency conversion is\n                      involved. The User's authorization of a payment using a\n                      foreign currency conversion rate displayed on the Site is\n                      at the User's sole risk.
